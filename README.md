# Dotfiles
My personal dotfiles used on [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/) and [OSX](http://www.apple.com/osx/).

## Installation
Keep in mind that those dotfiles and scripts are written for ArchLinux and OSX.
So it probably wont work as expected on other Linux distributions.

Before running the install script make sure you have installed the required dependencies.

To install the dotfiles simply run
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinvdburgt/dotfiles/master/briefcase/install | sh
```

## Folder structure
`.config/` This folder contains all configuration files for the applications i have installed on my machines.

`.fonts/` This folder contains all additional fonts used on my machines.

`.scripts/` This folder contains a lot of usefull scripts and utilities i often use.

`briefcase/` This folder contains a little Python application which keeps my dotfiles in sync across different machines.
