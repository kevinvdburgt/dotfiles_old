# Dotfiles - My Treasure Box

### Introduction
The public repository for my personal dotfiles. I'm planning to keep these dotfiles as up-to-date as possible across my multiple machines.

### Installation
Keep in mind that these dotfiles and scripts are primarily written for [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/) so it probably wont work as expected on other Linux distributions.

Before running the install script make sure you have installed the following packages: `git` and `python3`

To install the dotfiles, simply run:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinvdburgt/dotfiles/master/briefcase/install | sh
```

### Applications
- __window manager__: [bspwm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bspwm)

### Folder structure
`.config/` This folder contains all configuration files for the applications i have installed on my machines.

`.fonts/` This folder contains all additional fonts used on my machines.

`.scripts/` This folder contains a lot of usefull scripts and utilities i often use.

`briefcase/` This folder contains a little Python application which keeps my dotfiles in sync across different machines.
