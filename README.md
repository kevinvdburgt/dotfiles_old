# My personal dotfiles
This public repository contains my personal dotfiles. I'm planning to keep those dotfiles up-to-date as possible across multiple machines (MacBook Pro, ThinkPad (ArchLinux), several servers (mostly debian), ...).

Keep in mind that these dotfiles and scripts are primarly written for my personal use, so it probably wont work as expected on your machine.

## Installation
Simply run
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinvdburgt/dotfiles/master/briefcase/briefcase.sh | bash
```
or
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinvdburgt/dotfiles/master/briefcase/briefcase.sh | bash
```

## Current machines
- MacBook Pro 15" `chemistry` (running macOS 10.12.2 Sierra)
- ThinkPad L460 `xenon` (running ArchLinux)
- Personal Server `ika` (running Debian Testing)
- Home Server `burgt` (running Debian Testing)

## Folder structure
`briefcase/` This folder contains a dotfile sync script i've written over time for multiple platforms.

## Screenshots
***TODO**
